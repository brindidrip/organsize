Idea
=================================================================================
This application provides the functionality of segmenting any specified file into any specified segment size. Segment size must be smaller than the initial file. Application also allows for the reconstruction of segments back into original file with no bit alterations.  

TODO/BUGS
=================================================================================
- Number of segments and size of the segments are currently bounded by the maximum value of an integer. Need to fix long long data type bug.  

- Cross platform functionality
