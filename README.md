Idea
=================================================================================
This application provides the functionality of segmenting any specified file into any specified segment size. Segment size must be smaller than the initial file. The application also allows for the reconstruction of segments back into the original file with no bit alterations.   

Each segment has the following footer:

     ------------------------------------------------- 
    |   Segment signature   | Sequence | Total number |
    |                       |  Number  | of segments  |
    |-----------------------|----------|--------------|
    |       8 Bytes         | 8 Bytes  |    8 Bytes   |
     -------------------------------------------------- 
 
 Segment signature
 -----------------
 - Randomly generated bytes that are used as a signature for the segmentation process. All segments that were segmented during the same segmentation process will have this signature. Can be changed for less overhead. Signature is used to validate segments during reconstruction process.
 
 Sequence Number
 -----------------
 - Each segment is assigned a unique sequence number. The maximum sequence number is bound by the respective data type.
 - Used by std::sort to reconstruct segments back into original file.
 
 Total Number of Segments
 -----------------
 - Used for initialization and analysis/verification.
 
TODO/BUGS
=================================================================================
- Number of segments and size of the segments are currently bounded by the maximum value of an integer. Need to fix long long data type bug. 

- Cross platform functionality
